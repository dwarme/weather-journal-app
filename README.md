## Weather Journal App

# Overview

The Weather Journal App is a web application that allows users to record and view weather information based on their location. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and allows users to enter their zip code and feelings. The app then displays the temperature, date, and user's feelings on the webpage.

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. It demonstrates the use of Node.js and Express.js for server-side development, as well as asynchronous JavaScript and the Fetch API for making HTTP requests. The app also showcases dynamic UI updates using Vanilla JavaScript.
